# Weather-Dashboard

##Description

I have created an application where a user can enter the name of a city and it will display the current weather for that location, as well as the weather in 24 hour intervals for 5 days. It will show the user the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an image representing the weather. 
All past searches will appear below the search field as buttons that can be clicked on to bring up the weather data for that location, saving the need to type in a city name that you have already searched before.

##Installation

No installation needed. The code is deployed as a stand alone page on Git Pages, (https://karra-ormsby.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/)

##Usage

The user is presented with a search bar in which to search a city,

![search bar](./assets/images/Search%20bar.png)

Once a valid city name is entered and the search button is pressed the user is shown the current weather in a card,

![current weather](./assets/images/Current%20weather.png)

and a 5 day forecast below.

![5 day forecast](./assets/images/5%20day%20forecast.png)

The users past searches are stored in local storage and are presented as buttons below the search bar.

The user can press each button to bring up the weather for the city the button corresponds to.
